We got to Limestone but the Spirit of '02 is gone. They parked their little boat on the shore and it seems like they stuffed the damn thing in a truck and are going further upstream.

Whatever. We've gotta find where they're headed next, though. Given that they're our rivals, they can't be that smart, and yep, someone dropped their ID card. It's scuffed really badly and I can't seem to see most of the digits on them, but I definitely know that it's R, then eight digits with no spaces. Here's what I can tell, at least:

R 6??5?1??

As of what I know so far, they're definitely a football rival school in Texas.

What city are they going to bring that cannon back to?

Format: One word, capitalized. So if the city were [Waco, Texas], you would input [Waco].

ANSWER: Lubbock

SOLUTION: Searching for rivals of Texas for Texas A&M Football yields several: TCU, Baylor, Texas, SMU, Texas Tech. However, the numbers in the ID are not important; TCU has a nine-digit ID, Baylor nine digits, Texas 16 digits, SMU four dash four, Texas Tech R and 8 digits. The answer is then Texas Tech, so Lubbock.
