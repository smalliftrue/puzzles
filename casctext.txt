I was on a trip in Cascadia the other day, and I was quite astounded by the brilliant views of the Pacific Northwest. I took out my camera and took a picture. That night, however, when I went to look at the image, it was corrupted!

Over the next few days, a series of strange things happened. I received some things in the mail - a compressed bit of paper with some music notated on it, and a cryptic letter that I eventually made out as "find where you need to go." Maybe the corrupted image had something to do with it? 

So I hand the corrupted image to you. Maybe, just maybe, you'll help me find where I need to go.

Greatest thanks.

I decided to drive down to Corvallis. 

Many years ago, I used to work in the sheriff’s department in Portland. I had spent years chasing down a man named Alcala - a murderer with a special vendetta against me. He was confident. He would perform grotesque acts of murder, and then send me riddles to lure me to the bodies. He would always make sure I was the first one to see the gruesome sight, as if taunting me. I was always a step behind, and though I saw many of his deeds, for a long while, I never saw him.

But in 2004 I caught Alcala. A month later, I retired. That was it. My life’s goal. I had seen too much at that point.

When I got to Corvallis, I was too tired and just slept in the cheapest motel I could find. The next morning, however, a letter at my doorstep told me to drive down into the woods. 

What I saw chilled me to the bone. Yes, a lifeless body. And a note on the ground. Someone lured me here - and I think I know who it was.

Alas, the last time I deciphered Alcala’s riddles was more than two decades ago. Please just tell me where I need to go next to track him down once and for all.

It was time to head to Roseburg.

I hopped into the car and my phone buzzed. It was a message with a set of coordinates, on the outskirts of Roseburg. I had to get there quickly. Alcala liked to commit the murder right before I arrived, so I could see the body while it was still fresh. If I got there before he anticipated, I could catch him.

No matter. I cranked the car up and drove along the riverbank at full speed. I didn't care how dented the car would be. I needed to get Alcala.

Thankfully, following the riverbank, I ended up just a minute's walk from the indicated coordinates. It was dusk. I found Alcala slowly pacing around a shack in the forest, evidently waiting to do the deed. Slowly, slowly, I crept up to Alcala's shadowy figure. I pulled out my revolver and fired once. 

Alcala's lifeless body crumpled to the ground. I shot him again for good measure.

I inspected his bloody coat. There was a note inside the lining. Alas, it was another riddle, but a riddle that at least gave me some solace. Now, reader, please tell me what Alcala has left me.
