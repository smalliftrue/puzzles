Sun's coming up now. It's no good that we know they're going to Lubbock; who knows what they'll do with '02 there. We need to intercept them before the fact, we gotta find where they're headed at this moment.

Thankfully, we checked the back of the boat and found a paper with something printed on it:

"Use the survey and go to next geo feature id, 2113600 OR 299564, something like that."

The rest is a blur.

What city is the cannon headed to now?

FORMAT: One word, capitalized.

ANSWER: Carbon

SOLUTION: Use survey, go to next geo feature -> USGS features -> GNIS feature ID. 2113600 OR 299564 (bitwise) -> 2413164 -> Carbon, TX
